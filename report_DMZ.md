# DMZ Configuration Report with Cisco Packet Tracer

### 1. Lab Objective

> The objective of this lab was to configure a secure DMZ using a Cisco ISR router. This included assigning IP addresses, configuring static NAT to expose the web server to the external network, and implementing ACLs to control traffic between the LAN, DMZ, and External networks.

**Example:**  
Configure a secure DMZ using a Cisco ISR router, applying NAT and ACLs to control traffic between LAN, DMZ, and the external network.


### 2. Implemented Topology

> Describe the network. You can include an image if the software allows it (Packet Tracer screenshot).

- Number of networks: ____3______
- Devices used: 1 Cisco ISR Router, 3 Switches (LAN, DMZ, External), 1 Internal PC, 1 DMZ Web Server, 1 External PC
- Brief description of the function of each zone (LAN, DMZ, External).

### 3. IP Addressing Plan

Complete the table with the assigned IPs (you can copy it from the statement if it hasn't changed).

| Device                  | IP              | Mask              | Gateway           |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PC_Internal             |  192.168.1.10   |   255.255.255.0   |    192.168.1.1    |
| Server_DMZ              |  192.168.2.10   |   255.255.255.0   |    192.168.2.1    |
| PC_External             |  192.168.3.10   |   255.255.255.0   |    192.168.3.1    |
| Router_FW Gi0/0 (LAN)   |  192.168.1.0/24 |   255.255.255.0   |                   |
| Router_FW Gi0/1 (DMZ)   |  192.168.2.0/24 |   255.255.255.0   |                   |
| Router_FW Gi0/2 (Ext)   |  192.168.3.0/24 |   255.255.255.0   |                   |

### 4. Applied Configuration (Summary)

> Summarize the most relevant commands or steps you executed. Use text + code snippets as needed.

- Interfaces configured with `ip address`
- NAT:
```bash
ip nat inside source static 192.168.2.10 192.168.3.1
```
- ACLs:
```bash
access-list 101 permit tcp any host 192.168.3.1 eq 80
access-list 100 deny ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
```

### 5. Verifications Performed

> Describe the tests and their results. Include screenshots or command outputs if possible.

- `ping` from PC_Internal to the router: ✅
- Web access from PC_External: ✅
- Blocking access from DMZ to LAN: ✅

### 6. Conclusions and Recommendations

> What did you learn from this exercise? What would you improve?

**Example:**  
I learned to apply NAT and ACLs in a simulated environment. I recommend verifying basic connectivity before applying firewall rules, as an IP error can block everything.

### 7. Evidence Screenshots

> Attach here (or in an annexed PDF) the requested screenshots: pings, browser, `show` commands, etc.
